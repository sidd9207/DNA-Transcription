# DNA-Transcription
Converts a sequence of DNA into an mRNA sequence
# How it works
1) Program asks user to input a sequence of DNA nucleotide bases
2) The program will check to make sure the sequence that was input is valid. If not, it asks the user to enter a valid sequence
3) Once a valid sequence has been input, the program converts the sequences to its mRNA equivalent and outputs the mRNA code
